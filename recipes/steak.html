    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Kelci Jenkins. I'm the best chef in the world when it comes to cooking steak. I can make a mean
        steak just watch and see, but today I share to you my recipe to make the best steak you've ever cooked in your
        entire life!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ribeye or any cut of your choosing</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your steak and pat it dry on both sides with a clean paper towel to remove any wetness to ensure the
            seasoning sticks.</li>
        <li>Once the steak has been pat dry, add salt and pepper on both sides. A steak does not need to be seasoning to
            the gods as less is better!</li>
        <li>On a high heat, add your steak into the pan on its letting the crust develop a sear!</li>
        <li>Once you feel it is ready, put the steak face first and let cook for 5 minutes or depending on whatever temp
            you want you can eyeball it.</li>
        <li>Flip it so it can cook evenly.</li>
        <li>Once you think the steak is cooked evenly on both sides, take your butter add it onto the pan, crush your
            garlic and add it, and add rosemary. Take a spoon and add the golden buttery liquid on top of your steak
        </li>
        <li>Continue basing on high heat til your mouth starts to water. Take your steak off the stove and let it rest.
        </li>
        <li>After its done resting cut into that bad boy and take a bite out of the best steak you have ever cooked in
            your life and enjoy as the flavors coat your tongue!</li>
    </ol>
